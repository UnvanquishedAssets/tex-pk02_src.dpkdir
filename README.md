PK02 texture set for Unvanquished
=================================


About
-----

PK02 is a set of industrial textures initially designed with Quake 4 game in mind.

This texture set is a work by Philip “Blazeeer” Klevestav adapted for the [Unvanquished](https://unvanquished.net) game project.

This map is meant to be edited with a level editor like [NetRadiant](https://netradiant.gitlab.io/).

Visit the [Unvanquished website](https://unvanquished.net/) for more information about the game itself.
